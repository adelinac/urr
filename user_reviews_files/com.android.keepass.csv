136569,157084,7cc48230-afc9-11e6-badd-c4b301cdf627,com.android.keepass,This is an essential suite for any user -- desktop & mobile. I use Dropbox to keep one file updated for all platforms. THIS version has two major failings however. The first is that while the desktop version(s) use a file: DATABASE.KDB as the default  this mobile version insists on looking for a file called KEEPASS.KDB instead.. The second is the slavish devotion to a SANS-SERIF font! Without serifs you cannot distinguish a lower case L from an upper case i! And if your password uses either one  you're in for some grief. I suppose a third issues is that no matter how often you use this  it NEVER remembers where the password file is  or what it's called. Having this (and other things) employ the fingerprint security would be a huge plus  but not deal-breaking.,October 30 2016,3

136593,157109,7cc48fab-afc9-11e6-be45-c4b301cdf627,com.android.keepass,"This app is easy to use and I love it. It may be a bit hard to understand at first  but once you learn it  you can be as productive as possible. I've seen other KeePass apps that open databases  some that come with custom keyboards that you use a button to type a password in. I don't like that  because I have a hardware keyboard on my tablet  and I'd like not to waste screen space with an on-screen keyboard. This app takes an approach I've not seen; when you leave the app on an entry  it puts """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Copy password"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Copy username"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" notifications  so it even works with apps besides browsers! I personally see this as a genius idea and I love the app. Especially since I use the app OneDriveSync  this makes the transition between PC and tablet seamless. Only one problem I see: you can't set an icon for an entry or group. Or at least  I haven't figured it out yet. I was very happy to see that it displayed icons and this is  again  a feature that most apps lack. Great app overall  I love it.""""",September 18 2016,5

And if you have an Android device  you need to get KeePassDroid too. After all  you probably need that critical information with you throughout the day. KeePass + KeePassDroid along with Dropbox or some other Cloud storage will keep your passwords as secure as possible  but available when you need them.

It has every basic service you'd expect for security like timing out the database or clipboard. It lets you adjust these settings too. Why almost perfect? The design doesn't feel like most apps today  but more importantly there's no easy way to automate syncing databases.

The most convenient want to keep your database in sync with your other systems is via cloud storage. While Dropbox's functionality allows for KeepassDroid to work well with it  lack of Storage Access Framework (SAF) support means most other cloud providers (even Google Drive) don't work. Additionally  the design is dated. This app needs SAF support to handle most cloud providers  and could really use an influx of material design.

When I downloaded this app I copied my keepass .kdb file from my memory card to the microSD card in my phone and told KeePassDroid where it was  entered my master password and instantly had access to all my KeePassX passwords. It's MUCH more secure than trying to come up with passwords any other way and I've yet to have any online account of mine hacked to my knowledge. If you use KeePass on any other platform it should work seamlessly.,January 10 2015,5

137311,157872,7cc66121-afc9-11e6-aac1-c4b301cdf627,com.android.keepass,Great app  has served me well for years  but K2A is my new default I've used this app for years  and found it an absolutely invaluable portable password manager  especially when used with dropbox/equivalent. The strongest virtues of this app are it's full read/write support for kp1 and kp2 databases. However lack of updates and improvements have meant that Keepass2Android Password Safe has overtaken it in terms of general functionality and in terms of UI. While many will stick to KeePassDroid for it's simplicity and full read/write for all both database versions K2A has a cleaner easier to read UI  and optional integrated cloud hosting functionality  meaning you can view the latest file straight from Any cloud service you wish (I use Google Drive). I shall continue to use this app for writing to kdb files.,January 06 2015,5

With most  you don't  because you have to give them all kinds of internet connectivity permissions. How do you know what data they are leaking and to whom? You don't.

In either case  it only allows me to create a new database but fails to import my .kbd or .kbdx from my Google Drive. Too bad. I like KeePass a lot on Windows and somewhat on Linux (where I also had a bit of a hard time to import (only .kbdx worked)). Then had the bright idea to tap on the password database icon on Google Drive and voila: it works! Next trick is to make that file available offline. Works as well but with a dire warning. Apparently  saving to the local database on Android is experimental - which in my book doesn't make this app quite ready for prime time.,January 07 2014,3

137960,158571,f85378ff-15a0-11e7-9dbd-000c29dba5da,com.android.keepass,Be careful  this app used to clear clipboard when the app closes  it no longer does. So when you use it to copy and paste a password  it stays in your clipboard. Why should you care? Well  try pasting in any app hours after you close keepass and you will still see your password. Since clipboard is not secure  other apps on your phone can now see your password. I checed their help log and someone brought this up over 4 months ago and the problem persists. For a security app  this is very dangerous.,March 29 2017,2

137977,158590,76f5ab50-2d04-11e7-8745-000c29dba5da,com.android.keepass,If Keepass keeps asking you to find the database file every time you start the app  here's a workaround that worked for me: 1. Download the 'OI File Manager' App 2. Open OIFM and find your database file 3. Create a shortcut* to this file 4. Go to your home screen and click on the new shortcut 5. Select Keepass as the app to open it with 6. Login to your Keepass database  making sure the default database checkbox is ticked 7. Quit Keepass app 8. Re-open the app  by clicking on the Keepass icon (not the shortcut). Keepass should now have remembered the file location  and you can now delete the shortcut from your home screen and use Keepass as normal. Hopefully the developer can fix this soon! *create shortcut: on my phone  I had to press and hold the filename  then click the three dots to bring up the menu to see this option.,April 27 2017,4
