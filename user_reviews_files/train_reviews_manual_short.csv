769,5729be78507c690b8e0bd260,AcDisplay,03/08/04,Could be a very good app However it seems to be abandoned. There should be an option to change lock screen text color/opacity (or dim the brightness of it). It's too bright on amoled display.

There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement, IMO, such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space, why limit it?), allowing widgets to be wider (again, the space is there, why the limit?), being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock, and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also, custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly, an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.",Tony Russell,16/03/16,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
