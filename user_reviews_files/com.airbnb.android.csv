They do not offer any real traveling insurance or protection for the guest. A host can just cancel whenever they want and I guess airbnb figures while its not our problem! Just becasue I get a refund does not mean I am not inconvenienced. Do yourself a favor and stay at a hotel where real businesses and companies have some sort of obligation to their guests. Not some flaky person who you have never met and can turn your vacation into a real nightmare!

If you can actually get in touch with a human. And not a computer. The app itself if fine except you can not edit reviews after 48 hours. And they set a time limit of 14 days to leave a review. And you shall not ask to edit after that time cuz there is no way on God's green earth that airbnb will let you. Even though they could. They hide behind policy and try to protect their hosts instead of having an interest in their customer who pay their checks. Just kinda back words.

Wanted to be paid in full or we go so we had to pay and we couldnt leave as it would be a waste of money - $2000 a month for a 2 bedroom no living room opposed to the 3 bed with living room we were meant to get..

Been with them since 2011 and although their notion to be innovative  visionary  and good over all  the app is heavy  yet it has all the features you want as a guest and as a host. The new calendar layout as of jan 2017 is the best thing they have done since they made the app  and that is because i manage 10+ listings. I think they should make another strain of the app just for hosts that have many listings and is light to use  also I cant use this app on arch linux via arc welder method  while i can for other hotelier apps.,January 24 2017,1

The big problem is that this version is slow to load  clunky to operate and is a pain to use with some old features now well hidden.

The app was good until I clicked on a holiday card email from a previous host. The link took me to the airbnb website and asked me to log in. I am traveling and my mobile will not roam to any networks in the country. It asked me to verify by phone but since i can't get a code by SMS it locked my account as well as the app. Now its been two days since contacting AirBnB support and my account is still locked.

Was booking my next business trip but when I tried to book the travel credit was not applied. Tried to view the travel credit in my profile and each time I did the android app crashed. I thought it must be an app issue so I opened Chrome and tried to do the same through the Web interface. It did not even shoe my credit and the help Center had no solution and no way to contact help to answer my question. So I tried IE11 with same results. Finally Google to find contact info and got a number off a website of disfruntled users. They answered right away and applied the credit but offered no solutions for resolving the Web and Android app issued. I suspect this is a site built for Apple and is not compatible with Windows or Android apps. I do not recommend this company's software nor their online support.

For instance I want an entire place that's a loft  or tiny house etc. You used to be able to search that way. And though now it gives you search options for things to get into it has made the app look too busy. I'm all for suggestions on what's around yet I prefer simply talking to the host for that. I've also noticed  not certain if Its just a host end issue  that prices change once you select a place you're interested in. Going higher or lower  don't like that happens. Just to make clear I do enjoy airbnb very much  always our first to go to instead of hotels  yet if you allow hotels to be listed  or list all this other 'experiences' and what not  it takes away from the uniqueness that once was of airbnb/app. I'm all for change when its beneficial to a cause yet I liked the simplicity of choices now it just makes itself look busy to gather more guest.

Airbnb is aware of these problems and upon finally getting a hold of representatives on the phone and promptly responding to their email they offer nothing but silence and a still long overdue response. People on the phone can't even direct you to anyone until you have been assigned to a trip team.

I re-booked the reservation successfully this time using my debit card. 5) An hour later I got another e-mail stating my account was frozen for invalid payment method. 6) I called the number again  the woman there was in the process of locating Jazmin to resolve my problem when the call disconnected. 7) Called again  got Amber. She could not even find my account in her database using my email  phone  name  etc. She is forwarding my problem to the appropriate department. 8) They JUST charged me another $600 via paypal for the very first reservation that was canceled and refunded while my account was frozen.

You quickly have ur mind changed because of the hidden charges that some hosts add on at the end. It's wrong! Something else that's annoying!

Airbnb has left me sleeping in the street once because of a bug in their website and I couldn't even contact them.

Even using the same photo that was accepted for a passport isn't to the airbnb standard. Subsequently i cannot book anywhere as you are not able to get past the verification.

Most annoyingly  can't export a reservation to Google calendar any more! Could do this with the older version  I'm going to search the internet now and see if I can download the older version for this function specifically  as it makes keeping my own calendar much easier! Can't view what the guest pays when sending a special offer - defeats the object  since the guest is the one who requests an offer  you should be able to adjust your price according to what the guest pays rather than what you receive. Have lost out on bookings due to having to wait to be in front of a PC before sending offers. Needs a lot of improvement before you're able to manage multiple listings front your phone.,February 28 2017,2

1223572,1986607,c789e8a3-02a6-11e7-a2f0-000c29dba5da,com.airbnb.android,Pretty good way to keep track of your Airbnb stays. Unfortunately  there's no way to copy addresses. You can only jump to Google Maps and see them there. That would be acceptable if the links were correct. Unfortunately  they are not always right. I find I have to follow the link twice (i.e.  tap once  back out of maps and tap the link again) because the first time it only puts you in the vicinity. You have to re-follow the link to get closer to the actual address. This is a big hassle.,March 04 2017,3

The calendar is so hard to use now  I need to touch every single date to select it and change the availability or price. Before you could just drag over a range of dates to select  why did you remove this times saving useful feature? Also the calendar keeps opening up available dates 3 months out when you select you only want guests to be able to book within 3 months. It needs an option to only set certain dates as available  not automatically keep opening up dates in the future which you may not be around for to accept bookings  then need to explain to guests why you cannot accept their booking. This ruins the hosting and guest's experience.,March 07 2017,1

No real place to call someone to speak to. Their """"customer service"""" response via sporadic emails was actually rude and extremely unprofessional  like corresponding with internet trolls.

It was a nightmare. The host did not respond to my refund request and I've escalated the issue to Airbnb ad I haven't heard back after a month despite calling multiple times only to be told that no one knows anything about the claims process and managers don't speak to customers. I don't think using this service is a good idea because there are no standards that anyone is being held to and if you do have an issue the people that own this company just ignore you.

One of my hosts said she can rarely get the app working. I love travelling with Airbnb but have never yet encountered a problem. I looked for the emergency contact  on the website  to keep with my insurance claim number and other just-in-case details. There seems to be no way of getting in touch except to comment on a help article without hope of a response? Is this really true? What if the host is isn't around when I arrive and I'm stranded?... This is the example I remember  with the emergency contact number I remember seeing a couple of years ago. Has Airbnb changed to a policy of You're On Your Own  We Aren't Interested? Glad I haven't needed to request a refund or anything like that. The feedback system attracted me as its logic is unbreakable  and I was familiar with eBay.

1224127,1987280,d4132332-26a6-11e7-8ae9-000c29dba5da,com.airbnb.android,I'm an AirBnB host who has been using this app for years for both hosting and my own travel. I've always loved the app. There have not been many things that required me to use an actual computer...the app has had almost all of the functionality of the website. I hate to say that this dramatically changed with the most recent overhaul. They removed the host home/dashboard and replaced it with multiple pages/tabs. The calendar tab would have been great addition  but it is so slow on my Google Pixel that it's painful. Most times it takes up to 5 minutes to open. However  it opens immediately on my wife iPhone. The other problem is the one that's causing me the most grief. Evidently the internal clock in the app is like 5 hours ahead of the real time. Sometime between 7 pm and 8 pm  the calendar switches to the next day and no longer gives me information for the current day. For example  if I look at my calendar on Monday night at 8 pm  the first day listed on the calendar page will be Tuesday and it only show me guests checking in and checking out on Tuesday. I no longer can see Monday activities. This basically makes the app useless to me. There was an update pushed through this morning (4/20/17) that dramatically increase the speed which the calendar opens. However  there was a new problem. The first day that check-in/checkout activity is shown for is May 7th. I probably have 30 or 40 separate check-ins prior to May 7th  but the calendar just skips them. This is causing me a lot of headache and forcing me to use a computer and the website instead of the app that used to be so helpful. I've had no way of contacting anyone about these issues  so I had to do it by way of a review. AirBnB  please help.,April 20 2017,2

1224363,1987564,7358adba-398e-11e7-825f-000c29dba5da,com.airbnb.android,"I am very disappointed with air bnb. I used it for a trip to Spain and Portugal last summer and found it easy to use. I used it to a trip to Montana  Idaho  and North Dakota as well and found it a great way to stay in some interesting places  like an alpaca farm. Recently  I used air bnb to plan a trip in NZ with my mother. I have been here for three months already on a working holiday Visa  and have been earning New Zealand dollars. I found bookings which seemed like a good deal  sent them to my mother  and after she said they sounded good  I went to pay for the listings. The hosts were earning New Zealand dollars  I have a kiwi bank card with New Zealand dollars  but upon examining my bank statement I saw that I was charged a """"conversion fee"""" for all of the listings. In addition  when I went to pay  mandatory fees such as cleaning fees and an air bnb fee were added onto these listings. I don't mind paying the fees so long as they are included in the total cost  but I feel it is very misleading to list a room for $50 and the guest end up paying nearly twice that when all is said and done. I feel it would be much better to have mandatory fees included in the initial price quoted. I also feel it is very unfair to charge a conversion fee when the entire transaction is in one currency. I will not be using air bnb and I will not recommend this app to anyone else. To friends who ask me about my experience with air bnb  I will let them know they should use a different service",May 13 2017,1

In the end all they ll say is we will cancel your booking and your money will be refunded in 3-5 days  the probelm won't be resolved  they won't help you to find alternate accommodation (though blunder is on them with the current booking). I even pleaded them to transfer my money to my Airbnb account credit instead of refunding to my card  but they said they can transfer it only back to my bank n I'll have to wait 5 working days  such is there concern about the customers. When enquired about listing that property as """"verified"""" their answer astonished me. If the host has a email Id  social media Id and any govt Id (wont even take minutes for some one to prepare fake ids  that too everything is being uploaded as photos) they will list what ever that person post as a verified property.

1224432,1987655,8394c422-4077-11e7-b159-000c29dba5da,com.airbnb.android,My rating reflects the poor customer support and the phone number verification system. I have called various times to be given the same repetitive and scripted answers and questions. I would have preferred talking to a robot than to a person who's reading off a monitor and repeating the same questions after I explain myself over and over again. I find it strange for my license to be verified over a selfie ( could easily be forged doc. ) but the phone number is not allowed to be verified through an agent of yours. I am not using a VOIP number. In conclusion  you either fix your servers or allow verification of phone numbers through your agents for better customer satisfaction. I have also noticed that you are aware of this error for quite some time and no action has been taken. In this case  you should go through phone verification first  so people know if it works or not before sending you copies of sensitive personal information like passports and licenses.,May 23 2017,1

On 2 occasions the places we wanted already booked for the days we needed  which were immediate because it wouldn't let us book via the website or online.

But now that I don't work for them I decided to give them a try for the 1st time to my Trip to Havana  Cuba. I made reservation 2 months before and everything was fine. The host was super nice and communicated with me. She had everything setup for us even a driver. I hadn't left the country since I was 16 and never Have left the country since. Going to a third world country and a communist country was a little nerve-wracking. But I thought I was good. Guess what Aaron B&B sends me emails saying pack your bags your trip is coming soon all month long. Then 12 hours before it's time to leave they send me an email canceling my reservation. Granted this was not the host or myself canceling it was them. They didn't give me a straight answer something about they didn't think the reservation would look good or some public record I don't know? When I called they didn't give me a straight answer they assured me they would send me an email about what's going on. Which they never did. I was screwed. I was on my way to a third world country and I had nowhere to stay. Thanks Air B&B for nothing. I will never use them again. They months to do this and they do 12 hours before going to a communist country with communicatons. Screw you Airbnb. Ca Ca eaters,May 26 2017,1

Couldn't switch reservations for anything comparable and at the price point we had so after numerous requests to resolve we got no where. Fast forward to getting back stateside trying to get air bnb to answer a direct question proved more difficult than getting a straight answer out of Trump. They tell you a case manager will call you but 15+ days later not one has called back. My advice do what we are going to do show your cc company you tried to resolve the issue directly with them and you got tired of waiting and ask for them to pull the payment. Homeaway is my new app screw air bnb.,May 25 2017,1

1224521,1987760,90380485-455b-11e7-b318-000c29dba5da,com.airbnb.android,first time use airbnb and i get a problem. book a room to stay and the host has confirmed my booking. next day i drivr to the location and no body was in the apartment! this booking was in malaysia but the host provide a phone that is from france! i called the number but the line is not in service  sent message to the host and get no response at all. wasted almost one hour to wait there and rm3 for the parking fee. and what is even worst  i cant get refund of my rm107 booking fee back! first time using this app and encounter this kind of issue  if airbnb is not a famous app  i would highly doubt that this is a cheating app!,May 25 2017,1
1224522,1987761,90814286-455b-11e7-b318-000c29dba5da,com.airbnb.android,Latest version of the Android app(17.21) makes it very difficult to use filters with the map function. It doesn't seem possible to add more filters once an initial search has been made  nor can you see possible rentals on a map. This is a major step backwards  making it much more difficult to view possible rental properties.,May 25 2017,2
